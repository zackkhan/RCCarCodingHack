Code RC Car: A simple drag and drop user interface that teaches students how to program in a way that is fun, easy, and immersive! Code RC Car features an intuitive drag & drop interface allowing students to program an RC Car and learn basic programming concepts such as for loops. The app communicates via Bluetooth with an RC Car that our team took apart. We connected the motors of the RC Car to an Intel Arduino 101 allowing it to communicate efficiently with the app. We hope to continue developing the app and RC Car to make it an even more immersive tool for engaging students. We plan on bringing the app to local elementary schools and developing obstacle courses for students to program the RC Car for. Stay tuned!
